  <summary><h3>:rocket: My Physics Journey</h3></summary>
    <p>I am a graduate student currently transitioning to a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Physics, after having initially studied M.Sc. Astrophysics. My journey in physics began with a hands-on apprenticeship as a physics laboratory assistant at the VDZ in Düsseldorf, which gave me practical experience in experimental setups and data collection. This led to my role as a physics laboratory assistant, further honing my technical skills and deepening my understanding of the field.</p>
    <p>I earned my B.Sc. in Physics at the Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, where I not only developed a solid foundation in theoretical and experimental physics but also began to explore computational methods. My interest in programming sparked during the numerical methods course during which I started learning C++ and using Git for version control. During my bachelor's thesis on theoretical plasma physics, I learned MATLAB to model the process of laser wakefield acceleration of electrons.</p>
    <p>As I transitioned into my M.Sc. in Astrophysics at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-University Bonn, I continued to deepen my computational abilities, focusing on Python and key libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, Matplotlib, Astropy, and Pandas. Through various homework assignments, programming courses, and data analysis projects, I grew more comfortable with Python's versatility in both data manipulation and scientific computing.</p>
    <p>Along the way, I also picked up important tools to enhance my workflow, including LaTeX for writing reports and my thesis, as well as Vim for efficient text editing. I self-taught basic elements of Bash and YAML to further customize my terminal environment, and I continue to refine my skills using resources like YouTube, documentation, and platforms like ChatGPT to help troubleshoot and accelerate my learning.</p>
    <p>With a broad skill set spanning both experimental and computational physics, I am passionate about solving complex problems in physics, data analysis, and beyond. As I transition into an M.Sc. in Physics, I look forward to expanding my knowledge and contributing to cutting-edge research in the field.</p>
